            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a critical technique in web development that allows websites to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.</p>

            <h2>Why Responsive Design Matters</h2>
            <p>With the rise of smartphones and tablets, web developers needed a solution that would allow websites to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes without compromising user experience. RWD solves this issue through flexible layouts, fluid images, and media queries.</p>

            <h2>Key Elements of Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>The idea of responsive design revolves around flexible grids, media queries, and relative units like percentages rather than fixed pixels. This allows elements to resize proportionally to the viewport, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.</p>

            <h2>Modern Tools for Responsive Layouts</h2>
            <p>Flexbox and CSS Grid have revolutionized responsive design, giving developers more control over how elements are aligned and distributed within a container. They make it easier to create complex, responsive layouts with minimal code.</p>

            <h2>Future of Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>As the web continues to evolve, responsive design remains crucial. Future trends include responsive images, which load different file sizes based on bandwidth, and advanced techniques to optimize for a broader range of devices.</p>
