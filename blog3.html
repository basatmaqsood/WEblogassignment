            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) represent a new class of web applications that deliver a native app-like experience directly within the browser.</p>

            <h2>What Makes PWAs Unique?</h2>
            <p>By combining the best of both web and mobile applications, PWAs offer users the benefits of fast loading times, offline functionality, and push notifications without needing to install an app from an app store.</p>

            <h2>Offline Functionality</h2>
            <p>One of the key features of a PWA is its ability to work offline, thanks to Service Workers. These background scripts cache resources and allow the PWA to serve them even when the user is offline.</p>

            <h2>PWA Installation</h2>
            <p>Unlike traditional websites, PWAs can be installed directly to a device's home screen, running in a standalone window. Once installed, they integrate with the device's system features, offering a native-like experience.</p>

            <h2>Fast and Reliable Performance</h2>
            <p>PWAs are designed to be fast and reliable, even on flaky networks. Techniques like lazy loading and pre-caching ensure important parts of the app load quickly, while less critical resources are loaded in the background.</p>
